# ttt_pulsecannon
The Pulsecannon for TTT

This is a TTT pulse cannon, it is a T/D weapon that allows users to jump around across the map and go at varied speeds depending on how long they pulse for, (think of the TF2 soldier rocket jumping...except faster)

This is an addon made by Akechi with help from Infernus (UI) and Sparky, all and any original code is attributed to them.

Left Click: Small weak shots with a low delay between shots.
Right Click: Powerful shot with a 10 second cooldown.
